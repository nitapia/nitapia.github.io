# nitapia.github.io

Natalia Tapia nitapia@my.waketech.edu

github account: nitapia.github.io

The respository that was created indicates who I am and what my github account is with a brief description of how I was able to clone the repository onto my device 

In order to make a clone of my repository I clicked the "+" icon on the left corner of the screen selected "clone a repository." Which then opened a window that showed a list of the Github repositories. I chose the one named nitapia.github.io and for the location of the clone I had put it into a folder labeled CTI-110 located in the labs folder when you click that it brings you to a folder labeled lesson 6 Lab. Once thats clicked on it will go to the nitapia.github.io folder which than will lead to the README.md file.
